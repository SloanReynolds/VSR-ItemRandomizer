- Added seed to credits screen!
- Edited Title Screen to show cut material
- Randomized Puzzles!
- Added a hash of sorts in the form of sticky notes
- Removed config file in light of new UI stuff.
- Probably introduced a bunch of bugs

- Improved automated logic- just play the game and I'll find out if there's something "out of logic" received
