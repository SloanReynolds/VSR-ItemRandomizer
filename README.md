# Vision: Soft Reset - ItemRandomizer
Item Randomizer for the game Vision: Soft Reset

A Randomizer is a game mod where the items are shuffled around into random locations around the map. The original craze started with such SNES classics as Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid. This type of thing lends itself quite well to Metroidvanias in particular, and VSR is no exception.
